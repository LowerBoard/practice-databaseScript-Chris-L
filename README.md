# practice-databaseScript-Chris-L

This practice exercise was completed as part of the LaunchCode curriculum via pair programming. We selected scenario 1, which you can find below.  

Exercise instructions:  

For this activity, you will need to make sure you and your partner have both
completed the Practice: Generating a Database Script activity.
Using both your script and your partner’s, create and adapt a database for one of
the following scenarios:
1. You're developing a database for "Urban Eats," a restaurant chain that
operates multiple locations across the city. Each restaurant has its own menu
(though some items overlap), and they need to track customer orders across
all locations for analytics, inventory management, and customer loyalty
programs.
